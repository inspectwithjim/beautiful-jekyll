Payments are due when my services are provided.
 
Payment by check or cash is due when the on-site inspection is completed. A receipt is included with your copy of the Pre-Inspection Agreement.
 
Please tell me if you cannot attend the inspection. Correspondence will then be handled by email and USPS.  You may pre-pay by check by mail to me, or through your realtor. The fee is negotiated and set when the inspection is requested and scheduled.
